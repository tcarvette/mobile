        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>I received my high school diploma from Cranbrook Schools, a boarding school in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. <br>
        <br>
        At Cranbrook, I was a Residential Advisor in the dorms, a position where I helped new boarders through the transition of living away from home. <br>
        <br>
        I was a Peer-2-Peer Facilitator. Myself and one other facilitator ran a weekly discussion where students could feel safe talking about stressful issues. <br>
        <br>
        I was also a member of the Boy's Varsity Tennis Team.

        <h2>College</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Since enrolling in the University of Michigan in Fall 2018, I have switched from the College of LSA to the School of Information. <br>
        <br>
        I am now pursuing a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Analysis, with a minor in Entrepreneurialship. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The BSI Program has taught me the skills and knowledge to identify and ask questions that matter to stakeholders, gather essential data to answer the <br>
        <br>
        questions, find answers that are grounded in empirical evidence and present those answers in a convincing way. <br>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My first job was with ThirdCoastTennis.
        <br>
        I taught beginners the basics of tennis, and gave hitting sessions to advanced players looking to improve their game.
        <br>
        This job taught me how to deal with frustrated customers, as players would often get mad for not being able to make contact with the ball.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My second job was with the University of Michigan as an Instructional Aide for SI 206.
        <br>
        I had the opportunity to create chapters of the online textbook for students to use, and helped teach lecture content and lead review sessions in office hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently working as a Leasing Professional with <a href="https://www.dinersteincos.com/"></a>The Dinerstein Companies</a>.
        <br>
        Here, I am responsible for managing prospect communications, follow-ups, and leasing processes in support of Sterling Arbor Blu's ongoing leasing and marketing efforts.
        <br>
        I am also responsible for representing the company as a source of information for prospective student residents and their parents.
        <br>
        This is done by providing excellent customer service and managing resident requests, concerns, and complaints in a timely manner.
